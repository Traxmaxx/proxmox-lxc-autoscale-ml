### Detailed Descriptions

- **`/scale/cores`**: Allows you to set a specific number of CPU cores for a container. This is useful for adjusting resources based on the time of day or anticipated workload.
- **`/scale/ram`**: Lets you set the amount of RAM for a container. This can be used to allocate more memory during peak usage or reduce it during off-hours to save resources.
- **`/scale/storage/increase`**: Increases the storage size of the container’s root filesystem. This endpoint is particularly useful when a container’s storage requirements grow over time.
- **`/snapshot/create`**: Creates a snapshot of a container. Snapshots are essential for backup and recovery, allowing you to restore a container to a

 previous state if needed.
- **`/snapshot/list`**: Lists all snapshots for a given container. This endpoint helps you manage and review the available snapshots.
- **`/snapshot/rollback`**: Rolls back a container to a specific snapshot. Use this endpoint to revert changes made during the day or after testing new configurations.
- **`/clone/create`**: Clones a container, creating an exact copy under a new VM ID. This is ideal for testing or duplicating environments without affecting the original container.
- **`/clone/delete`**: Deletes a cloned container. This endpoint helps keep your environment clean by removing containers that are no longer needed.
- **`/resource/vm/status`**: Retrieves the current resource allocation and usage for a specific container, helping you monitor its performance.
- **`/resource/node/status`**: Provides an overview of the resource usage on a specific Proxmox node, allowing you to manage and optimize node performance.
- **`/health/check`**: Performs a health check on the API server to ensure it’s running correctly. This is useful for automated monitoring and alerting systems.
- **`/routes`**: Lists all available API routes, providing an overview of the endpoints you can interact with.

These routes offer a wide range of functionality, enabling comprehensive management of your LXC containers via simple HTTP requests.

## Logs

Logging is a critical component of managing and troubleshooting the LXC AutoScale API. The service generates several log files that provide detailed information about its operations.

### Log Files

- **`/var/log/autoscaleapi.log`**: The main log file for the API, containing detailed information about API requests, responses, and any internal processing.
- **`/var/log/autoscaleapi_access.log`**: Logs all incoming requests to the API, including timestamps, request methods, endpoints accessed, and the source IP addresses. This log is essential for monitoring API usage and identifying potential security issues.
- **`/var/log/autoscaleapi_error.log`**: Captures errors encountered by the API service. Reviewing this log can help diagnose issues and ensure that the API runs smoothly.

### Log Management

Regularly review these logs to monitor the health and performance of the API service. Consider implementing log rotation to manage disk space, especially in environments with high API traffic. You can use tools like `logrotate` to automate the rotation, compression, and removal of old log files.

Example `logrotate` configuration:

```bash
/var/log/autoscaleapi*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 640 root adm
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        systemctl reload lxc_autoscale_api.service > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
    endscript
}
```

This configuration rotates the log files daily, keeps seven days of logs, compresses old logs, and ensures the service continues to operate without interruption.

## Best Practices and Tips

### 1. Secure Your API

Given that the API allows direct control over LXC containers, it’s crucial to secure it properly. Consider the following measures:

- **Use a Firewall**: Restrict access to the API by configuring your firewall to allow only trusted IP addresses.
- **Enable HTTPS**: Protect data in transit by securing the API with HTTPS. You can use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle SSL/TLS encryption.
- **Implement Authentication**: Add basic authentication or API tokens to restrict access to authorized users only.

### 2. Monitor API Usage

Regularly monitor the `autoscaleapi_access.log` file to track API usage. Look for unusual patterns that could indicate unauthorized access or potential misuse of the API.

### 3. Automate Routine Tasks

Use cron jobs in combination with API requests to automate routine tasks such as scaling resources or creating snapshots. This reduces manual intervention and helps maintain optimal performance.

### 4. Test Before Production

When implementing new API routes or making changes to existing ones, always test in a non-production environment first. This helps ensure that the commands work as expected without disrupting live services.

### 5. Document Your API Usage

Maintain documentation of how your environment interacts with the LXC AutoScale API, including the routes used, the purpose of each request, and any scripts or automation tools that rely on the API. This documentation is invaluable for troubleshooting and for onboarding new team members.
